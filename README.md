# goScore (Golang Server)

**Simple URL's security score check tool. (implement by Golang and Chrome Extension.)**.

# solution

When you're search knowledge, suddenly you may see a alert by Security Scan tool.<br>
You have unfortunately displayed a site that contains a *malware script*.<br>
But you've search a lot of for learn. I don't blame you.<br>
<br>
**Can't we at least easily check if it's suspicious before we open it?**<br>
<br>
I created this tool with that in mind *for you*!<br>

# features

When you right-click and select **context menu**, it opens a **temporary tab** before URL be opened.<br>
In that tab, **request Golang API** on server and will check the following.<br>

- Can name **resolve on the Secure DNS server**?
- Is SSL certificate is **not free type**?
- Is **higher rank search results** on search engines?

Check results are displayed with a **score(star rate)**.

# installation

If you want to put it under the path, you can use the following.

```
go get github.com/yasutakatou/goScore

delete that binary. del or rm command. (it's simple!)

# usecase

|:---|:---|:---|
-debug|false|debug mode (true is enable)|
-cert|localhost.pem|ssl_certificate file path (if you don't use https, haven't to use this option)|
